# Windows desktop workflow

From the WSL repository root, use the same commands across all four apps:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build:desktop` | Signed ARM64 Release dev package |
| `npm run verify:desktop` | Full Windows Debug compile |
| `npm run install:desktop` | Build, update in place, launch |
| `npm run install:desktop -- --skip-build` | Reinstall the latest successful dev package |
| `npm run install:desktop -- --skip-build --dry-run` | Check the install without changing Windows |
| `npm run package:desktop` | Unsigned Store package |

Pass `-- --platform x64` for x64 or `-- --no-launch` when installing without
launching. The working tree is staged in a unique C: Windows TEMP directory,
cleaned after use. Logs and packages return to `.artifacts/windows-build/` in WSL.
Tracked release versions stay unchanged; dev revisions change only in staging.
Never uninstall to bypass an update error or silently replace a publisher.

The policy and implementation are shared, not copied per project. Read the
[shared build/install guide](../../../windows-build-tools/README.md), or open
`$WINDOWS_BUILD_TOOLS/README.md` when using a custom tools location. The launcher is
`scripts/windows-build` and the per-project manifest is `windows-build.json`.

`.codex/commands/build.md`, `install.md`, and `rebuild.md` are Codex task guides,
not automatically registered slash commands. Follow existing release workflows
for publishing, and leave changes uncommitted unless explicitly requested.

The repository skill `$desktop` supports the same build, verify and install
requests. Start a new Codex task to discover newly added repository skills.
