# Fix ownership of persisted named-volume mounts so the non-root remote user
# can write to them.
#
# Why this is needed: when Docker mounts a *fresh* named volume over a path
# that doesn't already exist (with the right ownership) in the image, it
# creates the mountpoint as root:root. The non-root user then can't write
# there — surfacing as "permission denied" the first time a tool (gh, claude,
# npm, …) writes into ~/.config, ~/.claude, /commandhistory, and friends.
#
# This is a drop-in, project-agnostic safety net: it auto-discovers every
# mount under the given roots and chowns any whose top-level owner is wrong.
# Idempotent — once a volume is correctly owned it's skipped on every later
# run, so it's cheap to invoke from postCreateCommand on every (re)build.
#
# Usage: fix-volume-perms.sh [ROOT ...]
#   ROOT defaults to the remote user's home plus /commandhistory.

# Derive the target user from the identity we're actually running as (the
# remote user during postCreate). REMOTE_USER can override. `id -un` is more
# reliable than $USER, which is often unset in postCreate.
USER_NAME="${REMOTE_USER:-$(id -un)}"
# getent isn't present on every base image (e.g. Alpine/musl); fall back to
# $HOME (set to the running user's home) and finally a conventional path.
